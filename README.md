A basic Rock Paper Scissors game made as a Blazor WASM PWA. 
It has statistics to keep track of your record and a hand renaming functionality as well.
You can provide your own names, or you can ask for random ones with the help of the API found at 'https://random-word-form.herokuapp.com'.
Everything is stored in local storage too, so you can pick it up right where you left it!
